# So, it's been 5 years.
My first hit in making Chrome extensions was _[SoundCloud-Player](https://akiba.cloud/soundcloud-player/)_ and now it's 5 years old from its [initial commit](https://github.com/S4WA/SoundCloud-Player/commit/8f67d8dd9323ae18e2fbc82c5f947d7f9cf565d9) apparently. 

I appreciate all of the users. Glad to know that I have grasped many people's feelings, or even about that I shared the same frustration with you guys when using SoundCloud while web-browsing at the same time. Glad that I wasn't the only one to feel such.

I also thank, from the bottom of my heart, the users who gave me feedback and bug reports. It helped me a lot, I tried my best to listen to you guys' opinions.

So, time really goes fast, eh? Many things about or around me have changed, so does my thoughts and skills. I must admit that this source code is absolutely terrible and is difficult to update if I'm being honest. For example, I added an option for customizing font in [version 1.3.1](https://github.com/S4WA/SoundCloud-Player/commit/f4a5fcb6d50be895843d869db996335dc06fcdab) or dark mode in [version 1.3.5](https://github.com/S4WA/SoundCloud-Player/commit/622526d102f6f85fd031d7c70ea9d39a00b50c4a). These are just examples, I got more from Google Forms or through emails. I couldn't make them any better without you guys' help. 

In the beginning, it looked like the image below. There are a few videos of its old verions recorded & uploaded on YouTube. If you're interested in check it out [the playlist here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOD7EH5lOfwgN0pHSu-w7zrFvvnTzrrSy).

Nothing has changed about finding it fun to watch the numbers increase on the graph in the Google Web Store dashboard. I was a bit of an addict at some point.

Regardless, I don't know how to feel about Google made something similar on their browser. I guess I gotta move on and make something new. 

Anyways, thank you guys again for using my Chrome extension.
